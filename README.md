# Cherry
*A Cherry on top!*

This is a Minecraft mod intended to clean up all the random bits of code I wrote over the years I was developing mods. I started many projects which never came to release, usually because they were too small or I ran out of ideas. Due to the nature of taking small ideas from all over the place, this mod has no theme and two parts may or may not interact at all.

I will also be including some of the smaller mods I wrote in this one, since they're pretty small and annoying to maintain as separate entities.

Mods/ideas I **might** implement:

- [Tools Done Right](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/2284573)
- Food Canisters
- Decorative items with purpose
- More in-depth signs
- [Heart Crystals](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1293095)
- Scratch-like programming interface
- [Snow+](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1284410)
- OP items creative menu (e.g. spawners)
- Alchemy (not sure about this one, sounds like it's own mod)
- Coins and mobs dropping coins
- [Craft Convenience](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/2548120)
- Random drop ores
- Palm trees
- More fish types
- Building blocks
- Corn plants
- Trampolines
- Anti-crafter
