Tools Done Right by NukeDuck ReadMe
Thank you for downloading Tools Done Right!

How to Install (it's easier than it looks):
    1.) Ensure that all instances of Minecraft are closed before starting, and ensure that vanilla Minecraft has been run at least once before starting.
    2.) If not already installed, download the correct version of Minecraft Forge:
        a.) Browse to http://files.minecraftforge.net/ using your preferred browser.
        b.) Look for the version of Minecraft the mod release is for under "Promotion", followed by "Recommended", or "Latest" if there is not a recommended build.
        c.) Look to the right of the name, where there are several links.
        d.) Click the link for "Installer" and download the file.
        e.) Run the installer - you now have Forge installed for the correct version:
            i.) If on Linux, this involves running the command "java -jar <jar location>".
    3.) If on Mac, skip to step 4. If on Linux, skip to step 5. If on Windows, follow the steps below:
        a.) Open a Run prompt using Windows Key + R.
        b.) Type in "%appdata%" and press Enter (Note: optionally, you may be able to type this into Windows Explorer directly).
        c.) Open the ".minecraft" folder and then "mods".
            i.) If "mods" does not exist, create it and open it.
        d.) Drag and drop or copy this archive into the "mods" folder.
        e.) Go to step 6.
    4.) Open Finder, and:
        a.) Browse to User/Library/Application Support/.minecraft.
        b.) Open the "mods" folder.
            i.) If "mods" does not exist, create it and open it.
        c.) Drag and drop or copy this archive into the "mods" folder.
        e.) Go to step 6.
    5.) Open your home folder, and:
        a.) Ensure that hidden files are shown (View->Show Hidden Files, may vary between distros).
        b.) Open the ".minecraft" folder and then "mods".
            i.) If "mods" does not exist, create it and open it.
        c.) Drag and drop or copy this archive into the "mods" folder.
        e.) Go to step 6.
    6.) Start Minecraft. The mod should now be installed!
        a.) Check this by clicking on the "Mods" button on the main menu.

Once installed, the mod will immediately take effect when in-game.
